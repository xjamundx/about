# About Jamund

## HOW I LIKE TO WORK

1. Driven by a broad goal around helping people (devs/customers/etc)
2. Tell me about the problem and let me come up with solutions (lots of thinking/writing in a journal)
3. It’s really helpful for me to bounce ideas off of others (ideally white-boarding an idea together)
4. My “initial design” is almost always a CR rather than a document
5. Usually I’m a mess for like 2 weeks thinking about a problem and then go into hyperfocus mode and quickly work on a complete solution OR go into bug-fix mode and try to accomplish as many small tasks as possible.
6. Sprints don’t really work for me


## TIME/HOURS THAT I LIKE TO WORK

1. 10-4 
2. I WFH and have kids and often have to leave my desk abruptly
3. Mornings and afternoons I’m usually distracted heavily by kids
4. Almost never respond to after hours things
5. Hate early morning meetings


## HOW I LIKE TO COMMUNICATE

1. Slack over email, but don’t treat it like IM (i.e. no “hi”)
2. I mostly ignore email (seriously)
3. Strongly prefer video+audio to audio only. I need to see you to process non-verbal cues.
4. Love giving/planning power points. It really helps me clarify my thoughts.
5. I use a fair bit of hyperbole when telling my stories, watch out for that!

## WHAT DRAINS ME

1. Not making a decision (or not moving forward)
2. Pointless meetings
3. Fighting over who is in charge
4. Politics or trying to “impress” people
5. Nitpicking at Big Ideas 

## HOW I LIKE TO GET/GIVE FEEDBACK

1. I love when people find bugs in my code and push me to test things harder
2. I hate when people are nit-picky with my code though
3. Love to receive your feedback, but help me understand *why this is important*
4. I really love the book Non-Violent Communication and the approach they use to giving non-judgmental feedback. Don’t assume I understand “why” try to focus on the “what” and be clear with how it’s affecting me and what my needs are  (I know it’s a whole thing!)
5. I have 0 problems telling you/or your boss exactly how I feel, but I also try to be kind (don’t always get the balance right)


## WHAT EARNS TRUST WITH ME

1. Not being political or manipulative. No BS.
2. Owning your mistakes
3. Giving me honest feedback about my code or design (help me be better!)
4. Showing that you have a strong vision or a goal (help me believe in you!)
5. Seeing that you will listen to other people’s ideas
6. Learn from past experience
7. Prove that you know your technical stuff


## WHAT I ENJOY DOING

1. Listening to music (also collect vinyl)
2. Going to concerts
3. Dates with my wife (movies or food)
4. Jiu Jitsu
5. Bike rides
6. Dog Walks
